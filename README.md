<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Gym App </h1> <br>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    This gym application is an upgraded version of my previous gym application, which was
    developed in class. Its purpose is to display a list of exercises from a database and retain records of previous
    weights used while behing able to to have multiple differnet users.
